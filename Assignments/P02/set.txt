Program 2 Sets
Set A = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Set B = {7, 8, 9, 10, 11}
The intersection of Sets A and B = {7, 8}
The union of Sets A and B = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}
A – B = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
B – A = {9, 10, 11}
A complement = {3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}
B complement = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}
